# Open WebUI Desktop Client (Electron)
I've developed a straightforward desktop client for Open WebUI using the Electron framework.


This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Open WebUI website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Ctrl + G, Open WebUI can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder.
